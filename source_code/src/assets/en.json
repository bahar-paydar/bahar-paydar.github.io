    "title": "Who Am I?",
    "content": "I am a software developer and user interface designer. I learned C/C++ and Java as part of my bachelor degree; and later I learned Python and Web Technologies through self-study. I have kept my knowledge and my skills up to date by continously reading documents and developing mini applications. I also attended the Master of Science(MSc) program in Information Security at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) which I left without completing my thesis due to personal reasons. Eventhough I didn't receive my degree, I gained invaluable insight into security protocols and practices used in software development."
